# EdgeInMind

## The Ultimate Resource for Traders Seeking an Edge in the Market

This NextJS project is a basic blog website, that also had a tools section. The tools includes calculators for traders to uses for quickly figuring out order placement prices, number of share etc.

The site uses NextJS SSG (Static Site Generation), and On-Demand Revalidation ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration). That rebuilds the static site whenever a post is published or removed from the backend database. Using [PluralPost](https://github.com/mtmclennan/PluralPost) for a backend, to retrieve post data at build time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
